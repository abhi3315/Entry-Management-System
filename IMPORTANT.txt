I used TWILIO api to send sms and shared the code on git hub with authentication key.
Because of some privacy policies and security purpose my twilio trial account has been suspended and can not be used to send sms..
So I made some changes in sendsmshost.py and removed authentication key and some other confidential data.

So to send sms: 
1. You have to create a account on twilio.
2. Go to dashboard.
3. Choose a number to send SMS.
4. Copy a ACCOUNT SID and paste it in sendsmshost.py as followed:
	account_sid = 'paste ACCOUNT SID here'
5. Copy AUTH TOKEN and paste it in sendsmshost.py as followed:
	auth_token = 'paste AUTH TOKEN here'
6. Copy your NUMBER provided to send sms and paste it in sendsmshost.py as followed:
	from_='paste NUMBER here'

if you are using a trial account of twilio then you can not send sms to any number. You have to add the number first. visit: â€œhttp://twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/verified"
